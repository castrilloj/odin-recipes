    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>There is nothing cozier or more soothing to the soul than a warm bowl of 
        Homemade Ramen. You’ll never use a flavor packet again once you try this 
        protein-packed, flavorful, brothy, noodle soup.</p>

    <p>Searing chicken in the pot adds fond (i.e. flavor!) to the soup pot 
        right off the bat, which is then deglazed with white wine, 
        which amps up all of the other flavors in the recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>8 oz. mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large boneless/skinless chicken breast</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large soup pot over 
            medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms. Sauté until golden, about 4 minutes. 
            Remove and set aside so that they retain the color, flavor, and texture.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2 thinner slices. 
            Cover with saran wrap and use the textured side of a meat mallet to 
            pound it to ½ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken dry and season each side with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
